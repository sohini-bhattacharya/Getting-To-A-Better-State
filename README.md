# GETTING TO A BETTER STATE

## Getting Started

Getting to a better state is a insuarance company application that uses flutter and dart tools. It employs various database management techniques that help users to apply and predict their health premiums in real-time. Our home page consists of two views- User view and Employee view. Clicking on the user view the user can register on the app and futher apply for a health premium based on their age and gender. Clicking of the employee view, we'll be directed to a login page from which only the company employees can login. Futher these employees will be directed to a page where they can view a list of clients.
For mananging the database, we used sqlite package.We used sql-techniques such as - Insertion, Update, Triggers, Join, Transcation  etc.
